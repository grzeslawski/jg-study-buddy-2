# Getting Started with Studdy buddy app

This app is created based on course of react from youtube channel Hello Roman. When creating this app I learned about react hooks, msw-data, integration and end-2-end tests, simple authorization, handling errors, redux and redux-toolkit, hoc and render props.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Please use on device > 1236px, mobile view is not ready

## Login and password to log in

login: teacher@studybuddy.com\
password: Test1234

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Launches the test end to end from cypress

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
